# NEGSC
A self-supervised graph representing learning method named NEGSC, is proposed to identify the types of network intrusion attacks for edge-sensitive net flow traffic.

• The graph self-attention mechanism for edge-oriented features, named NEGAT, is introduced, to obtain graph representation encoding from the raw netflow data while avoids a great increase in computational complexity for attention weights between edges.

• NEGSC focuses on edge features, can automatically extract feature representations in local graph structures, and generate positive and negative samples for training without manual labels, and has good adaptability and flexibility for real-time detection of network traffic.

• We introduced this unsupervised method into the multi-classification task of network intrusion detection for the first time, and achieved the results with potential application in both the multi-classification and binary classification tasks.
